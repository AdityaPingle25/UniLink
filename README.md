UNILINK
1️⃣ Introduction

UniLink is a web-based academic portal designed to connect students and faculty through a centralized platform. The system provides structured access to academic announcements, events, certification submissions, and login portals.

2️⃣ Problem Statement

In many colleges, students face difficulty in tracking:

Academic events

Scholarship deadlines

Certification submissions

Official announcements

Information is often scattered across different platforms.

Therefore, there is a need for a centralized academic portal that provides organized access to institutional updates.

3️⃣ Objective

The main objectives of UniLink are:

To design a clean and responsive landing page.

To create structured navigation for events and announcements.

To provide separate login access for students and faculty.

To build a visually appealing hero section.

To ensure the page is fully responsive and non-scrollable.

To implement proper UI design principles.
